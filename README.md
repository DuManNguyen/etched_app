# etched

Etched is a mobile application built on the basis of Google UI toolkit Flutter using the programming language Dart to give parents an efficient way of safekeeping and exhibiting precious family moments with the ability to store images, text and printable collage/journal hybrid. Flutter allows the application to be cross-platform but an issue faced is having it function effectively and meeting the requirements given to go cross-platform. 

## App releasing

There are two main release formats when publishing applications to the Android platform. They are put on your app on Google Play Store through the app bundle releasing or packing program in the APK installation format.  However, due to budget constraints and with no plans for future versions releases, we decided to only deliver an APK format product to our client for Android ends.
